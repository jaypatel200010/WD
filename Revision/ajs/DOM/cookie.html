What are Cookies ?
Web Browsers and Servers use HTTP protocol to communicate and HTTP is a stateless 
protocol.But for a commercial website, 
it is required to maintain session information among different pages. 

For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. 
But how to maintain users' session information across all the web pages.

In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, 
purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.

How It Works ?
Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. 
The browser may accept the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. 
Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, 
the browser sends the same cookie to the server for retrieval. 
Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored earlier.

Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields −

Expires − The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.

Domain − The domain name of your site.

Path − The path to the directory or web page that set the cookie. 
This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.

Secure − If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server.
 If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.

Name=Value − Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key-value pairs


Storing Cookies

document.cookie = "key1 = value1;key2 = value2;expires = date";

Here the expires attribute is optional. If you provide this attribute with a valid date or time, 
then the cookie will expire on a given date or time and thereafter, the cookies' value will not be accessible.

Note − Cookie values may not include semicolons, commas, or whitespace. For this reason, 
you may want to use the JavaScript escape() function to encode the value before storing it in the cookie. 
If you do this, you will also have to use the corresponding unescape() function when you read the cookie value.
