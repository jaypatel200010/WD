<!--
void is an important keyword in JavaScript which can be used as a 
unary operator that appears before its single operand, 
which may be of any type. 

This operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value.

--> 
 
 <!--
 Here the expression alert ('Warning!!!') is evaluated but it is not loaded back 
 into the current document âˆ’
 
 -->
 <p><p>Click the following, This won't react at all...</p></p>
 <a href = "javascript:void(alert('Warning!!!'))">Click me!</a>     
 
 
 
 <!--
 
 The following link does nothing because the expression "0" has no effect in JavaScript. 
 Here the expression "0" is evaluated, but it is not loaded back into the current document.
 
 -->
 
<a href = "javascript:void(document.write('hello'))">Click me!</a>      


<!--
We can use the operand 0 in two ways that are void(0) or void 0. Both of the ways work the same. 
The JavaScript:void(0) tells the browser to "do nothing" i.e., prevents the browser from reloadin		g or refreshing the page. 
It is useful when we insert links that have some important role on the webpage without any reloading.
 So, using void(0) on such links prevents the reloading of the page but allows to perform a useful function such as updating a value on the webpage.

<a href ="" >  
It will do nothing.  
</a>
<a href = "javascript:void(0);"  onclick="">  
It will do nothing.  
</a>
