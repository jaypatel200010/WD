Celsius vs. Fahrenheit

Celsius is the world’s most widely used temperature scale, 
commonly known as Centigrade and written 
as °C. Celsius is most widely used in scientific and medical applications because 
it is simpler to work with. Fahrenheit (written as °F) is still commonly used in many everyday 
applications in the United States.

F=(C×5/9)+32

<script>

let c = 50;
let f = 0;

// Using the above formula
f = (c * (9 / 5)) + 32;
document.write("The value of the temperature in Fahrenheit is " + f);
